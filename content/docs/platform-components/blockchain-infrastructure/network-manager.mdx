    a block.
  - **Max Messages Per Batch**: Controls block size.
- **Consensus Type**: Typically `etcdraft`, a Raft-based ordering service.

#### Network Governance and Security

Hyperledger Fabric networks require robust security and governance mechanisms:

- **Membership Service Provider (MSP)**: Controls identity verification and
  authentication, ensuring only authorized participants can access the network.
- **Root Certificates and TLS Certificates**: Define trusted entities for secure
  communication.
- **Endorsement Policies**: Determine how transactions are validated across
  organizations, enforcing compliance and preventing unauthorized modifications.

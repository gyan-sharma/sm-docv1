**InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)** is a **decentralized and distributed file storage system** designed to enhance the way data is stored and accessed on the web. Unlike traditional cloud storage solutions that rely on centralized servers, **IPFS stores content across a peer-to-peer (P2P) network**, making it **efficient, secure, and resilient** against failures and censorship.

Within **SettleMint**, **IPFS is available as a storage option**, allowing developers to **store, retrieve, and manage files seamlessly** for blockchain applications. It enables **off-chain data storage**, ensuring that blockchain networks remain efficient while still being able to reference large datasets securely.
[Learn more on IPFS here](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/)

### Why Use IPFS?

- **Decentralized & Fault-Tolerant** – No single point of failure.
- **Content Addressability** – Files are retrieved using unique cryptographic **Content Identifiers (CIDs)** rather than URLs.
- **Efficient Storage & Bandwidth Optimization** – Files are **de-duplicated and distributed** across nodes.
- **Ideal for Blockchain Applications** – Enables **off-chain storage** while linking data securely to on-chain smart contracts.
- **Scalable & Cost-Effective** – No dependency on expensive centralized storage solutions.

SettleMint offers **IPFS as a decentralized storage solution**, allowing users to store data in a **distributed, verifiable, and tamper-proof manner**. This is particularly useful for **storing large files, metadata, documents, NFTs, and other digital assets** that would otherwise be expensive or inefficient to store directly on-chain.

### Features of IPFS Storage in SettleMint

- **Seamless File Upload & Retrieval** – Store files and retrieve them via **CIDs**.
- **Blockchain Integration** – Reference IPFS-stored files within **smart contracts**.
- **Secure & Immutable Storage** – Files stored on IPFS remain **tamper-proof**.
- **Enhanced Performance** – Optimized file access through **IPFS gateways**.
- **Redundancy & Availability** – Files are distributed across the network for increased resilience.

## API Reference

SettleMint provides **multiple APIs** for interacting with IPFS:

| **Method** | **Endpoint**            | **Description**                                    |
|------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `POST`     | `/ipfs/upload`          | Uploads a file to IPFS and returns its **CID**.   |
| `GET`      | `/ipfs/{CID}`           | Retrieves a file from IPFS using its **CID**.     |
| `POST`     | `/ipfs/pin/{CID}`       | Pins a file to prevent it from being removed.     |
| `DELETE`   | `/ipfs/unpin/{CID}`     | Unpins a file, allowing it to be garbage collected. |

For full API specifications, refer to **SettleMint’s API documentation**.

## Credentials & Authentication

To interact with **SettleMint’s IPFS cluster**, users need authentication credentials:

| **Credential**             | **Description** |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Cluster API Username**   | Identifies the IPFS cluster user. |
| **Cluster API Password**   | Required for **authentication**. |
| **Peer ID**                | Unique identifier for the node in the IPFS network. |
| **Public Key**             | Used for **cryptographic verification**. |
| **Private Key**            | Enables secure **signing of IPFS transactions**. |
| **Pinning JWT Token**      | Required for interacting with the **Pinning API**. |

These credentials ensure **secure access** to the IPFS storage layer.


## Add Storage

<Tabs items={['Platform UI', 'SDK CLI', 'SDK JS']}>
  <Tab value="Platform UI">
    Navigate to the **application** where you want to add storage. Click **Storage** in the left navigation, and then click **Add storage**. This opens a form.

    <Steps>
      ### Configure Storage
      1. Choose storage type (IPFS or MinIO)
      2. Choose a **Storage name**
      3. Configure deployment settings
      4. Click **Confirm**
    </Steps>

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="SDK CLI">
    First ensure you're authenticated:
    ```bash
    settlemint login
    ```

    Create storage:
    ```bash
    # Get the list of available storage types
    settlemint platform create storage --help

    # Create storage
    settlemint platform create storage <type> <name>

    # Get information about the command and all available options
    settlemint platform create storage <type> --help
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="SDK JS">
    For a full example of how to connect to a storage using the SDK, see the [MinIO SDK API Reference](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@settlemint/sdk-minio#api-reference) or [IPFS SDK API Reference](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@settlemint/sdk-ipfs#api-reference).

    <Callout type="info">
    Get your access token from the Platform UI under User Settings → API Tokens.
    </Callout>

    <Callout type="info">
    The SDK enables you to:
    - Use IPFS for decentralized storage - check out the [IPFS SDK documentation](https://github.com/settlemint/sdk/tree/main/sdk/ipfs)
    - Use MinIO for S3-compatible storage - check out the [MinIO SDK documentation](https://github.com/settlemint/sdk/tree/main/sdk/minio)
    </Callout>

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Manage Storage

<Tabs items={['Platform UI', 'SDK CLI', 'SDK JS']}>
  <Tab value="Platform UI">
    Navigate to your storage and click **Manage storage** to:
    - View storage details and status
    - Monitor health
    - Access storage interface
    - Update configurations
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="SDK CLI">
    ```bash
    # List storage instances

    };

    // Get storage details
    const getStorage = async () => {
      const storage = await client.storage.read("storage-unique-name");
      console.log('Storage details:', storage);
    };

    // Delete storage
    const deleteStorage = async () => {
      await client.storage.delete("storage-unique-name");
    };
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>


## Use Cases for IPFS in Blockchain Applications

### 1. **Smart Contract Data Storage**  
   - Instead of storing large data **on-chain**, store it **off-chain** on IPFS and reference the **CID** in smart contracts.
   - Example: **Legal documents, digital agreements, audit records**.

### 2. **NFT Metadata & Digital Assets**  
   - Store **metadata, images, and media** for NFTs in a decentralized and tamper-proof manner.
   - Example: **NFT artwork, game assets, token metadata**.

### 3. **Decentralized Identity & Credentials**  
   - Store and verify **identity documents, certificates, and credentials** securely on IPFS.
   - Example: **Verifiable credentials in education, healthcare, and finance**.

### 4. **Immutable Data Storage for Regulatory Compliance**  
   - Ensure **auditable and tamper-proof records** for compliance-heavy industries.
   - Example: **Financial records, compliance reports, supply chain tracking**.

## Best Practices & Considerations

- **Pinning Important Files** – IPFS operates on a caching mechanism, meaning files may be garbage-collected if not pinned.
- **CID Management** – Since CIDs are content-based hashes, file updates result in new CIDs. Maintain proper reference tracking.
- **Security & Privacy** – IPFS is **public by default**. For sensitive data, consider **encryption before storing files**.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **File Not Found?** – Ensure the file is **pinned** and accessible through an active IPFS node.
- **Slow Retrieval?** – Use **SettleMint’s dedicated IPFS gateway** or public **IPFS gateways** for faster access.
- **Storage Limitations?** – Consider using **external pinning services** to maintain long-term file availability.

For further assistance, refer to **SettleMint's documentation** or the **official IPFS documentation**.

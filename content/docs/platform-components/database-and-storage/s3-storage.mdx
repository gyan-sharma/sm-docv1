solutions**. MinIO supports **self-hosted, private cloud, and hybrid
environments**, allowing users to maintain full control over their storage
infrastructure.

MinIO’s architecture enables **high-speed read/write operations, horizontal
scalability, and strong data protection**. It supports **erasure coding,
encryption, and identity access management (IAM) policies**, ensuring secure and
efficient storage. Its lightweight nature allows it to run on **bare-metal
servers, containers, and Kubernetes clusters**, making it a versatile
alternative to centralized cloud storage solutions.

## API & Integration

MinIO’s **S3-compatible API** enables seamless integration with existing
applications that rely on S3 storage. Common API operations include:

| **Method** | **Endpoint**              | **Description**                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `PUT`      | `/s3/upload`              | Uploads a file to MinIO storage.                   |
| `GET`      | `/s3/{bucket}/{filename}` | Retrieves a file from MinIO storage.               |
| `DELETE`   | `/s3/{bucket}/{filename}` | Deletes a file from MinIO storage.                 |
| `POST`     | `/s3/presigned-url`       | Generates a pre-signed URL for secure file access. |

By leveraging these APIs, developers can build **storage-driven applications**
without modifying existing **S3-compatible services**.

## Security & Access Control

MinIO includes robust **security mechanisms** for protecting stored data:

- **IAM Policies** – Define user roles and permissions for managing storage
  access.
- **Data Encryption** – Supports **AES-256 encryption** for data at rest and
  **TLS encryption** for data in transit.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** – Configure **bucket-level and object-level
  permissions** for restricted access.

### Managing Storage Credentials

Users interacting with MinIO storage typically require **secure credentials**:

| **Credential**  | **Description**                               |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Access Key**  | Used for authenticating API requests.         |
| **Secret Key**  | Provides secure access to MinIO buckets.      |
| **Bucket Name** | Represents the storage container for objects. |
| **Region**      | Defines the MinIO deployment environment.     |

These authentication mechanisms ensure **data integrity and controlled access**
across all storage operations.

## Best Practices for Using MinIO

- **Enable Encryption** – Encrypt stored data to **prevent unauthorized
  access**.
- **Use IAM Policies for Access Control** – Implement **role-based policies** to
  manage user permissions effectively.
- **Monitor Storage Utilization** – Regularly track **storage usage and
  performance** to optimize efficiency.
- **Replicate Data for Redundancy** – Ensure high availability by using
  **multi-node clusters**.

## Add Storage

<Tabs items={['Platform UI', 'SDK CLI', 'SDK JS']}>
  <Tab value="Platform UI">
    Navigate to the **application** where you want to add storage. Click **Storage** in the left navigation, and then click **Add storage**. This opens a form.

    <Steps>
      ### Configure Storage
      1. Choose storage type (IPFS or MinIO)
      2. Choose a **Storage name**
      3. Configure deployment settings
      4. Click **Confirm**
    </Steps>

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="SDK CLI">
    First ensure you're authenticated:
    ```bash
    settlemint login
    ```

    Create storage:
    ```bash
    # Get the list of available storage types
    settlemint platform create storage --help

    # Create storage
    settlemint platform create storage <type> <name>

    # Get information about the command and all available options
    settlemint platform create storage <type> --help
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="SDK JS">
    For a full example of how to connect to a storage using the SDK, see the [MinIO SDK API Reference](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@settlemint/sdk-minio#api-reference) or [IPFS SDK API Reference](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@settlemint/sdk-ipfs#api-reference).

    const listStorage = async () => {
      const storages = await client.storage.list("your-app-id");
      console.log('Storage instances:', storages);
    };

    // Get storage details
    const getStorage = async () => {
      const storage = await client.storage.read("storage-unique-name");
      console.log('Storage details:', storage);
    };

    // Delete storage
    const deleteStorage = async () => {
      await client.storage.delete("storage-unique-name");

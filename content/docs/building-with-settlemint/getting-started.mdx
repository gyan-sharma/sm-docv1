# Application development journey on SettleMint

1. **Blockchain infrastructure setup** (network and node configuration)
2. **Smart contract development** (code, test, deploy)
3. **Middleware & API Creation** (auto-generated REST/GraphQL endpoints and
   APIs, smart contract indexing)
4. **Off-Chain data srorage and integration** (storage, databases, enterprise
   systems)
5. **Security & compliance** (private key management, token-based
   authentication)
6. **Deployment & scaling** (packaging your app for production)

**Brief Step-by-Step Guide** to help you create a working blockchain app
quickly.

### 1. Lay the foundation

Use the **Blockchain Network Manager** to configure a public (e.g., Ethereum) or
private (e.g., Besu, Quorum, Fabric) network. Deploy **Blockchain
Nodes**—validating for consensus, non-validating for load distribution. Add a
**Blockchain Load Balancer** to handle traffic and set up the **Transaction
Signer** for secure transaction submissions. Finally, confirm everything is
operational in the **Blockchain Explorer**.

<ins>Brief Step-by-Step Guide:</ins>
1. Define application scope (supply chain, identity, etc.). 
2. In the Network Manager, select and configure your network (public or private). 
3. Spin up validating or non-validating nodes. 
4. Enable load balancing and secure transaction signing. 
5. Check network activity and node health in the Explorer.

### 2. Develop and deploy smart contracts

Write on-chain logic in **Code Studio** (Solidity/Chaincode) or the **SDK CLI**.
Rely on frameworks like Foundry/Hardhat for testing, then compile and deploy
once you’re satisfied. The platform tracks deployments for easy rollback and
version control.

<ins>Brief Step-by-Step Guide:</ins>
1. Write your contract using Code Studio or your preferred IDE. 
2. Test thoroughly using built-in or external test frameworks. 
3. Compile and deploy to a test network. 
4. Inspect events in the Explorer to verify success. 
5. Move to production upon final validation.

### 3. Enable APIs and middleware

The **Smart Contract API Portal** converts your contract ABI into immediate REST
or GraphQL endpoints. The **Graph Middleware** handles read operations, indexing
on-chain data for fast queries. If required, the **Ethereum Attestation
Indexer** can manage trust attestations for identity or compliance.

<ins>Brief Step-by-Step Guide:</ins>
1. Upload your contract ABI to the Smart Contract API Portal. 
2. Check automatically generated REST/GraphQL endpoints. 
3. Configure Graph Middleware for event indexing using sub-graphs 
4. Add specialized indexers (e.g., EAS) for credential or compliance data. 
5. Test endpoints in a simple front end or script.

### 4. Integrate and finalize the application

Enterprise-grade dApps often require off-chain data handling. Connect **S3
(MinIO)** or **IPFS** for files, and use **Hasura** on PostgreSQL for structured
data. Meanwhile, orchestrate off-chain triggers with the **Integration Studio**
(e.g., emailing the admin after a token transfer). By the end, your blockchain
logic seamlessly interacts with centralized services.

<ins>Brief Step-by-Step Guide:</ins>
1. Decide on S3 vs. IPFS for file needs. 
2. Implement Hasura GraphQL for off-chain data queries and updates. 
3. Configure events in Integration Studio to automate workflows. 
4. Sync on-chain calls and off-chain records in real time.
5. Confirm data consistency and reliability via logs or Explorer audits.

### 5. Secure and comply

Select the right private key management strategy—software, HD wallets, or
HSM—based on your security profile. Use **Access Tokens (PAT/AAT)** for
controlling platform or API interactions. Align deployments with recognized
certifications (ISO 27001, SOC 2) to ease compliance processes.

<ins>Brief Step-by-Step Guide:</ins>
1. Pick a key management approach that fits your risk tolerance. 
2. Issue PATs for developers, AATs for back-end services. 
3. Set up logging, monitoring, and regular security reviews. 
4. Conduct or schedule compliance audits as needed. 
5. Document any custom security protocols for internal reference.

### 6. Deploy, monitor, and scale

Finally, **containerize** your front end (React, Angular, Vue) and back-end
microservices. SettleMint’s **Custom Deployments** module makes updates
simpler—no downtime or big reconfigurations. Continuous monitoring checks
performance and security, letting you expand capacity as your user base grows.

<ins>Brief Step-by-Step Guide:</ins>
1. Package all components into containers. 
2. Deploy them (SaaS or Self-Managed)
via SettleMint’s interface. 
3. Benchmark performance under typical and peak loads. 
4. Fine-tune scaling rules and resource allocations. 
5. Iterate on your solution as usage patterns evolve.

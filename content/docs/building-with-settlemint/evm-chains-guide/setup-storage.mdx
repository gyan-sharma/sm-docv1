# Off-chain File Storage Use Cases in Blockchain Applications

Blockchain applications often require storing documents, images, videos, or
metadata off-chain due to cost, performance, or privacy reasons. Two common
approaches are:

- **IPFS**: A decentralized, content-addressed file system ideal for immutable,
  verifiable, and censorship-resistant data.
- **Amazon S3**: A centralized, enterprise-grade storage solution that supports
  private files, fine-grained access control, and fast retrieval.

Below are separate use case tables for each.

## üåê IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)

IPFS is a decentralized protocol for storing and sharing files in a peer-to-peer
network. Files are addressed by their content hash (CID), ensuring immutability
and verification.

| **Content Publishing**     | Articles, Audio files, Podcasts, Open knowledge archives                               |
| **Gaming & Metaverse**     | 3D assets, Wearables, In-game items, IPFS-based map data                               |
| **Token Ecosystems**       | Whitepapers, Token metadata, Proof-of-reserve documents                                |
| **Data Integrity Proofs**  | Merkle tree files, Hashed content for audit, CID-linked validation                     |
| **Hybrid dApps**           | On-chain reference to CID, IPFS-pinned metadata, Public shareable URIs                 |
| **Data Portability**       | Decentralized content backups, Peer-to-peer file sharing, Long-term open data archives |

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)

Amazon S3 is a centralized cloud storage platform that offers speed,
scalability, and rich security features. It is especially suitable for private
or enterprise-grade applications.

| Category                      | Use Cases                                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **KYC / Identity Management** | Encrypted KYC files, ID document storage, Compliance scans, Signature uploads           |
| **User Uploads**              | Profile pictures, File attachments, Media uploads, Form attachments                     |
| **Admin Dashboards**          | Exported reports, Internal analytics files, Logs and snapshots                          |
| **E-Commerce / Marketplaces** | Product images, Order confirmations, Receipts, Invoices                                 |
| **Private DAO Ops**           | Budget spreadsheets, Voting records, Internal documents                                 |

## Summary: When to Use Which?

| Use Case Pattern                      | Recommended Storage |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Public, immutable content             | **IPFS**            |
| Verifiable, on-chain linked data      | **IPFS**            |
| Private or role-based content         | **S3**              |
| Fast real-time access (UI/media)      | **S3**              |
| Hybrid (IPFS for hash, S3 for access) | **Both**            |

Each system has unique advantages. For truly decentralized applications where
transparency and verifiability matter, IPFS is a natural fit. For operational
scalability, secure access, and enterprise-grade needs, S3 provides a reliable
foundation.

In hybrid dApps, combining both ensures performance without compromising on
decentralization.

## Add Storage

<Tabs items={['Platform UI', 'SDK CLI', 'SDK JS']}>
  <Tab value="Platform UI">
    Navigate to the **application** where you want to add storage. Click **Storage** in the left navigation, and then click **Add storage**. This opens a form.

    <Steps>
      ### Configure Storage
      1. Choose storage type (IPFS or MinIO)
      2. Choose a **Storage name**
      3. Configure deployment settings
      4. Click **Confirm**
    </Steps>

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="SDK CLI">
    First ensure you're authenticated:
    ```bash
    settlemint login
    ```

    Create storage:
    ```bash
    # Get the list of available storage types
    settlemint platform create storage --help

    # Create storage
    settlemint platform create storage <type> <name>

    # Get information about the command and all available options
    settlemint platform create storage <type> --help
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab value="SDK JS">
    For a full example of how to connect to a storage using the SDK, see the [MinIO SDK API Reference](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@settlemint/sdk-minio#api-reference) or [IPFS SDK API Reference](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@settlemint/sdk-ipfs#api-reference).

    <Callout type="info">
    Get your access token from the Platform UI under User Settings ‚Üí API Tokens.
    </Callout>

    <Callout type="info">
    The SDK enables you to:
    - Use IPFS for decentralized storage - check out the [IPFS SDK documentation](https://github.com/settlemint/sdk/tree/main/sdk/ipfs)
    - Use MinIO for S3-compatible storage - check out the [MinIO SDK documentation](https://github.com/settlemint/sdk/tree/main/sdk/minio)

      console.log('Storage instances:', storages);
    };

    // Get storage details
    const getStorage = async () => {
      const storage = await client.storage.read("storage-unique-name");

  Summary
  <div style={{ fontSize: "16px", fontWeight: "normal", marginTop: "5px" }}>
    You should start by writing your Solidity smart contract and set up a deployment script using Hardhat Ignition. Then, you should compile your contract to generate the necessary artifacts and test it using either Foundry or Hardhat to ensure all functions work correctly. 
    
    Finally, you should deploy your contract to a local or platform network to get a fully functional smart contract ready for integration with your dApp.

The goal of this tutorial is to design and build a simple User Profile Manager
using Solidity. While the visible use case is centered around managing user
profiles (such as name, email, age, etc.), the hidden objective is to
demonstrate the core thought process behind building a smart contract that can
store, update, read, and soft delete data on the blockchain.

This example is intentionally kept simple and non-technical in terms of
blockchain identity (no wallets or signatures involved) to help beginners focus
on the fundamentals of: - Designing smart contract data structures (structs and
mappings) - Writing public and restricted functions to interact with data -
Emitting and responding to events - Handling update and soft delete logic to
mimic realistic scenarios (Understand that transaction data is never deleted,
just a more recent entry is added about that record in a newer block on
blockchain)

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll not only learn the foundational patterns
that apply to many real-world blockchain applications but also understand how to
develop and deploy smart contracts on SettleMint platform.

## CRUD Mapping for the Smart Contract

This table maps traditional Web2-style CRUD operations to the equivalent Solidity functions in the smart contract:

| **CRUD**   | **Solidity Function** | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Create** | `createProfile()`      | Adds a new user profile to the blockchain using a unique `userId`. This simulates an `INSERT` operation in databases. It checks that the profile does not already exist (unless soft-deleted) and stores the user's details. Emits `ProfileCreated` with full data for off-chain indexing.                                                   |
| **Read**   | `getProfile()`         | Retrieves an existing profile by its `userId` — similar to a `SELECT` query in SQL. It returns the user's profile only if it hasn’t been soft-deleted. This function is marked `view`, meaning it does not modify blockchain state and can be called without gas.                                                                          |
| **Update** | `updateProfile()`      | Modifies all fields of an existing user profile. Acts like an `UPDATE` in Web2 databases. It ensures the profile exists and is not deleted, then updates it with the provided values. Emits `ProfileUpdated` with full details for off-chain use.                                                                                            |
| **Delete** | `deleteProfile()`      | Performs a **soft delete** by setting the `isDeleted` flag to `true`, without removing the actual data from storage. This is similar to a logical delete used in many enterprise databases. The data remains on-chain (for auditability), but `getProfile()` will no longer return it. Emits `ProfileDeleted`.                              |


## 2. Let's add this smart contract to code studio

When you deploy an **Empty** smart contract set on SettleMint platfrom, you get
a very simple **Counter.sol** contract as an example, you may delete it.

In the contracts folder create a file called **User.sol** and copy paste the
content of the above smart contract code.

## 3. Prepare deployment script

In **Ignition** folder, you will find a folder called **Modules**, there you
will find a **main.ts** file which is basically a contract deployment script.
You may delete it if you already know or once you understand the structure.
In this folder create a file called **deployUser.ts**

### Understanding the deployment script code structure.

```ts
import { buildModule } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition/modules";

const UserModule = buildModule("UserModule", (m) => {
  const user = m.contract("User");
  return { user };
});

export default UserModule;
```

**Let's understand key parts of this code-**

This deployment script uses Hardhat Ignition to define and execute the
deployment of a smart contract. It begins by importing the buildModule function
from the Ignition library, which is used to define a deployment module. The
module is named "UserModule" and is constructed using a callback function that
receives a context object m.

Within this function, m.contract("User") declares that a contract named User
(which must match the name inside the Solidity source file) should be deployed.
This is how it knows which contract is being refered.

The deployed contract instance is stored in a variable called user. This
instance is then returned from the module so it can be accessed later if needed.
Finally, the module is exported as the default export so it can be run by
Hardhat’s Ignition system using the CLI.

## 4. Compile the smart contract code

When a Solidity smart contract is compiled, the source code is transformed into
low-level bytecode that can be executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
This process also generates important metadata such as the ABI (Application
Binary Interface), which defines how external applications or scripts can
interact with the contract’s functions and events. Additionally, the compiler
produces debugging information, source maps, and compiler settings. These
outputs are essential for deploying, testing, and integrating the contract with
dApps or frontend applications.

![Compile smart contract code](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/evm-compile.png)

When you compile a Solidity smart contract in SettleMint , it processes .sol
files and generates various output artifacts needed for deployment and
interaction. For example, after compiling User.sol, you get the following inside
the artifacts/ directory:

📂 artifacts/contracts/User.sol/ 
- Counter.json – This is the main artifact file. It contains the ABI (Application Binary Interface) - The compiler metadata 
- Counter.dbg.json – Debugging info including source maps and AST 
- Counter.d.ts – TypeScript definition file for better type safety when using the contract in frontend or scripting environments 
- artifacts.d.ts – Global TypeScript declarations for all compiled contracts

📂 artifacts/build-info/ 
- hash.json – Contains detailed compiler input/output and full metadata for the build process, useful for verifying or analyzing compilation details

## 5. Test the smart contract

Smart contract testing is a critical part of the development lifecycle in
blockchain and decentralized application (dApp) projects. Since smart contracts
are immutable once deployed to the blockchain, bugs or vulnerabilities can
result in permanent loss of funds, data corruption, or security breaches.
Thorough testing ensures that smart contracts behave as expected under various
scenarios and edge cases before they go live on the mainnet.

Testing frameworks like Hardhat and Foundry provide robust tooling to write and
execute tests in Solidity or JavaScript/TypeScript. These frameworks offer
helpful utilities such as assertions, mock accounts, blockchain state
manipulation (e.g., time travel or snapshot/rollback), and expected reverts.
Additionally, testing libraries like forge-std/Test.sol (in Foundry) or chai (in
Hardhat) enable expressive and readable test assertions.


### Foundry test

In the **test** folder in IDE, create a **User.t.sol** file for HardHat test
script.

It uses forge-std/Test.sol is a powerful utility library provided by Foundry’s
standard library (forge-std) that simplifies writing and executing tests for
smart contracts. It extends the base Solidity Test contract and includes a rich
set of assertions, cheatcodes, and debugging tools that make testing more
expressive and efficient.

When a test contract inherits from Test, it gains access to functions like
assertEq, assertTrue, fail, and testing cheatcodes such as vm.prank,
vm.expectRevert, vm.roll, and many more. These tools simulate complex behaviors
and edge cases in a local testing environment without the need to manually
manipulate the EVM state. For example, vm.expectRevert allows developers to
anticipate and verify error conditions, while assertEq simplifies comparisons
between expected and actual results.

### Hardhat test

Start test network using **Hardhat - Start Network** script in task manager.
![Start Hardhat Local Network](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/hardhat-local-network.png)

In the **test** folder in IDE, create a **User.ts** file for HardHat test
script.

This test script leverages Hardhat’s modern support for viem, a lightweight and
fast alternative to Ethers.js, designed for more efficient interaction with
Ethereum contracts. The test uses loadFixture from
hardhat-toolbox-viem/network-helpers to ensure test isolation and efficient
deployments—each test gets a clean contract instance to work with.

Inside the script, we define a fixture function (deployUserFixture) to deploy
the User contract and provide access to the publicClient. The tests cover all
core functionalities of the contract: creating, updating, reading, and
soft-deleting user profiles. Assertions are written using Chai’s expect syntax,
while contract interactions (like write.createProfile and read.getProfile)
follow the Viem pattern, making the test code both concise and expressive.

```ts
import { loadFixture } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox-viem/network-helpers";
import { expect } from "chai";
import hre from "hardhat";

// Describe our test suite for the User contract
describe("User", function () {
  // deployUserFixture deploys the User contract using viem and returns the deployed contract instance
  // along with the address of the first wallet client.
  async function deployUserFixture() {
    // Deploy the User contract using viem.
    // The contract name ("User") must match your contract’s name.
    const userContract = await hre.viem.deployContract("User");
    // Get the first wallet client's account address to use as a signer for simulate calls.
    const account = (await hre.viem.getWalletClients())[0].account.address;
    return { userContract, account };
  }

  // Define a sample user profile object for tests.
  const sampleProfile = {
    userId: 1n, // BigInt literal is used for user IDs
    name: "Alice",
    email: "alice@example.com",
    age: 30,
    country: "Wonderland",
    isKYCApproved: true,
  };

Please run **Hardhat Test** script to test the smart contract

![Hardhat Test Pass](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/hardhat-test-pass-cli.png)

Once the test is pass, you can deploy to local hardhat network by using script - **Hardhat - Deploy to Local Network**

![Hardhat Deploy Local](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/hardhat-deploy-local-cli.png)

If you click on **Hardhat Deploy to Local Network** and nothing happens, then you are missing the step to select the correct deployment script and hitting enter key. 
You will see a message - **Extra commandline arguments, e.g. --verify (Press 'Enter' to confirm or 'Escape' to cancel)** in the top middle of the IDE, hit enter, you will see **ignition/modules/main.ts**, edit the last part at put the correct filename (e.g. deployUser.ts), basically the name of the deployment script you created in ignition folder, and hit enter agian to run the deployment script.
This remains true for all the deploy cases, whether on local network or platform network.

## 6. Deploy the smart contract

Hardhat deploy to platform network enter the path of the deployment script
![Select node to deploy](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/select-deployment-script.png)

Select the node to which you wish to deploy this smart contract. If you get an
error, please ensure that a private key was created and attached to the node on
which you wish to deploy the smart contract.
![Select node to deploy](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/select-node-cli.png)

Select the private key you wish to use to deploy smart contract. If you are
using a public network or a network with gas fee, then make sure that this
private key's wallet is funded.
![Select private key to deploy](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/select-private-key-cli.png)

Select yes when prompted - **Confirm deploy to network (network name)? ›
(y/N)**.

Wait for a few minutes for the contrcat to be deployed.

![Contract Deployed](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/contract-deployed-cli.png)

Deployed contract address is stored in deployed_addresses.json file located in igntition>deployments folder.

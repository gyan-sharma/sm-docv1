  Summary
  <div style={{ fontSize: "16px", fontWeight: "normal", marginTop: "5px" }}>
    You should start by writing your Solidity smart contract and set up a deployment script using Hardhat Ignition. Then, you should compile your contract to generate the necessary artifacts and test it using either Foundry or Hardhat to ensure all functions work correctly. 
    
    Finally, you should deploy your contract to a local or platform network to get a fully functional smart contract ready for integration with your dApp.

The goal of this tutorial is to design and build a simple User Profile Manager
using Solidity. While the visible use case is centered around managing user
profiles (such as name, email, age, etc.), the hidden objective is to
demonstrate the core thought process behind building a smart contract that can
store, update, read, and soft delete data on the blockchain.

This example is intentionally kept simple and non-technical in terms of
blockchain identity (no wallets or signatures involved) to help beginners focus
on the fundamentals of: - Designing smart contract data structures (structs and
mappings) - Writing public and restricted functions to interact with data -
Emitting and responding to events - Handling update and soft delete logic to
mimic realistic scenarios (Understand that transaction data is never deleted,
just a more recent entry is added about that record in a newer block on
blockchain)

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll not only learn the foundational patterns
that apply to many real-world blockchain applications but also understand how to
develop and deploy smart contracts on SettleMint platform.

Let's see how it maps to our Web2 CRUD Operations

| **CRUD**   | **Solidity Function** | **Explanation**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Create** | `createProfile()`     | Adds a new user profile to the blockchain using a unique `userId`. This simulates an `INSERT` operation in databases. It ensures that a profile doesn’t already exist or has been previously soft-deleted.                                                                                                                                   |
| **Read**   | `getProfile()`        | Retrieves an existing profile by its `userId`, only if it hasn’t been soft-deleted. Works like a `SELECT` statement to view data. This function is marked `view`, meaning it doesn’t cost gas to call.                                                                                                                                       |
| **Update** | `updateProfile()`     | Modifies all fields of an existing profile. If the profile exists and is not deleted, it overwrites the data with new values — similar to an `UPDATE` in SQL.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Delete** | `deleteProfile()`     | Performs a **soft delete** by setting the `isDeleted` flag to `true`. The profile remains stored on-chain but is no longer accessible via `getProfile()`. This mimics a logical delete in systems where data immutability is important. Unlike traditional databases, data written to the blockchain is permanent, we can’t truly delete it. |

## 2. Let's add this smart contract to code studio

When you deploy an **Empty** smart contract set on SettleMint platfrom, you get
a very simple **Counter.sol** contract as an example, you may delete it.

In the contracts folder create a file called **User.sol** and copy paste the
content of the above smart contract code.

## 3. Prepare deployment script

In **Ignition** folder, you will find a folder called **Modules**, there you
will find a **main.ts** file which is basically a contract deployment script.
You may delete it if you already know or once you understand the structure.

### Understanding the deployment script code structure.

In this folder create a file called **deployUser.ts**

```
import { buildModule } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition/modules";

const UserModule = buildModule("UserModule", (m) => {
  const user = m.contract("User");
  return { user };
});

export default UserModule;
```

**Let's understand key parts of this code-**

This deployment script uses Hardhat Ignition to define and execute the
deployment of a smart contract. It begins by importing the buildModule function
from the Ignition library, which is used to define a deployment module. The
module is named "UserModule" and is constructed using a callback function that
receives a context object m.

Within this function, m.contract("User") declares that a contract named User
(which must match the name inside the Solidity source file) should be deployed.
This is how it knows which contract is being refered.

The deployed contract instance is stored in a variable called user. This
instance is then returned from the module so it can be accessed later if needed.
Finally, the module is exported as the default export so it can be run by
Hardhat’s Ignition system using the CLI.

## 4. Compile the smart contract code

When a Solidity smart contract is compiled, the source code is transformed into
low-level bytecode that can be executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
This process also generates important metadata such as the ABI (Application
Binary Interface), which defines how external applications or scripts can
interact with the contract’s functions and events. Additionally, the compiler
produces debugging information, source maps, and compiler settings. These
outputs are essential for deploying, testing, and integrating the contract with
dApps or frontend applications.

![Compile smart contract code](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/evm-compile.png)

When you compile a Solidity smart contract in SettleMint , it processes .sol
files and generates various output artifacts needed for deployment and
interaction. For example, after compiling User.sol, you get the following inside
the artifacts/ directory:

📂 artifacts/contracts/User.sol/ - Counter.json – This is the main artifact
file. It contains the ABI (Application Binary Interface) - The compiler
metadata - Counter.dbg.json – Debugging info including source maps and AST -
Counter.d.ts – TypeScript definition file for better type safety when using the
contract in frontend or scripting environments - artifacts.d.ts – Global
TypeScript declarations for all compiled contracts

📂 artifacts/build-info/ - hash.json – Contains detailed compiler input/output
and full metadata for the build process, useful for verifying or analyzing
compilation details

## 5. Test the smart contract

Smart contract testing is a critical part of the development lifecycle in
blockchain and decentralized application (dApp) projects. Since smart contracts
are immutable once deployed to the blockchain, bugs or vulnerabilities can
result in permanent loss of funds, data corruption, or security breaches.
Thorough testing ensures that smart contracts behave as expected under various
scenarios and edge cases before they go live on the mainnet.

Testing frameworks like Hardhat and Foundry provide robust tooling to write and
execute tests in Solidity or JavaScript/TypeScript. These frameworks offer
helpful utilities such as assertions, mock accounts, blockchain state
manipulation (e.g., time travel or snapshot/rollback), and expected reverts.
Additionally, testing libraries like forge-std/Test.sol (in Foundry) or chai (in
Hardhat) enable expressive and readable test assertions.


### Foundry test

In the **test** folder in IDE, create a **User.t.sol** file for HardHat test
script.

It uses forge-std/Test.sol is a powerful utility library provided by Foundry’s
standard library (forge-std) that simplifies writing and executing tests for
smart contracts. It extends the base Solidity Test contract and includes a rich
set of assertions, cheatcodes, and debugging tools that make testing more
expressive and efficient.

When a test contract inherits from Test, it gains access to functions like
assertEq, assertTrue, fail, and testing cheatcodes such as vm.prank,
vm.expectRevert, vm.roll, and many more. These tools simulate complex behaviors
and edge cases in a local testing environment without the need to manually
manipulate the EVM state. For example, vm.expectRevert allows developers to
anticipate and verify error conditions, while assertEq simplifies comparisons
between expected and actual results.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

import { Test } from "forge-std/Test.sol";
import { User } from "../contracts/User.sol";

contract UserTest is Test {
    User public user;

    // Deploy a fresh User contract before each test
    function setUp() public {
        user = new User();
    }

    // Test: Successfully create a user profile and verify its fields.
    function test_CreateProfile() public {
        user.createProfile(1, "Alice", "alice@example.com", 30, "Wonderland", true);

        User.UserProfile memory profile = user.getProfile(1);

        assertEq(profile.name, "Alice");
        assertEq(profile.email, "alice@example.com");
        assertEq(profile.age, 30);
        assertEq(profile.country, "Wonderland");
        assertTrue(profile.isKYCApproved);
        assertFalse(profile.isDeleted);
    }

    // Test: Successfully update an existing profile.
    function test_UpdateProfile() public {
        user.createProfile(1, "Alice", "alice@example.com", 30, "Wonderland", true);
        user.updateProfile(1, "Alice Updated", "alice@new.com", 31, "Newland", false);

        User.UserProfile memory profile = user.getProfile(1);

        assertEq(profile.name, "Alice Updated");
        assertEq(profile.email, "alice@new.com");
        assertEq(profile.age, 31);
        assertEq(profile.country, "Newland");
        // isKYCApproved was updated to false.
        assertFalse(profile.isKYCApproved);
    }

    // Test: Deleting a profile should prevent further access.
    function test_DeleteProfile() public {
        user.createProfile(1, "Alice", "alice@example.com", 30, "Wonderland", true);
        user.deleteProfile(1);

        // getProfile should revert because the profile is marked as deleted.
        try user.getProfile(1) {
            fail(); // Expected getProfile to revert for deleted profile.
        } catch Error(string memory reason) {
            assertEq(reason, "Profile not found or has been deleted");
        }
    }

    // Test: Duplicate profile creation should revert.
    function test_RevertOnDuplicateCreate() public {
        user.createProfile(1, "Alice", "alice@example.com", 30, "Wonderland", true);
        vm.expectRevert(bytes("Profile already exists"));
        user.createProfile(1, "Bob", "bob@example.com", 40, "Atlantis", false);
    }

    // Test: Updating a non-existent profile should revert.
    function test_RevertOnUpdateMissingProfile() public {
        vm.expectRevert(bytes("Profile does not exist or has been deleted"));
        user.updateProfile(99, "Ghost", "ghost@example.com", 99, "Nowhere", false);
    }

    // Test: Deleting a non-existent profile should revert.
    function test_RevertOnDeleteMissingProfile() public {
        vm.expectRevert(bytes("Profile already deleted or doesn't exist"));
        user.deleteProfile(123);
    }
}
```

### Hardhat test

Start test network using **Hardhat - Start Network** script in task manager.
![Start Hardhat Local Network](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/hardhat-local-network.png)

In the **test** folder in IDE, create a **User.ts** file for HardHat test
script.

This test script leverages Hardhat’s modern support for viem, a lightweight and
fast alternative to Ethers.js, designed for more efficient interaction with
Ethereum contracts. The test uses loadFixture from
hardhat-toolbox-viem/network-helpers to ensure test isolation and efficient
deployments—each test gets a clean contract instance to work with.

Inside the script, we define a fixture function (deployUserFixture) to deploy
the User contract and provide access to the publicClient. The tests cover all
core functionalities of the contract: creating, updating, reading, and
soft-deleting user profiles. Assertions are written using Chai’s expect syntax,
while contract interactions (like write.createProfile and read.getProfile)
follow the Viem pattern, making the test code both concise and expressive.

```ts
import { loadFixture } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox-viem/network-helpers";
import { expect } from "chai";
import hre from "hardhat";

describe("User", function () {
  async function deployUserFixture() {
    const userContract = await hre.viem.deployContract("User");
    const account = (await hre.viem.getWalletClients())[0].account.address;
    return { userContract, account };
  }

  const sampleProfile = {
    userId: 1n,
    name: "Alice",
    email: "alice@example.com",

## 6. Deploy the smart contract

Hardhat deploy to platform network enter the path of the deployment script
![Select node to deploy](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/select-deployment-script.png)

ignition/modules/deployUser.ts

Select the node to which you wish to deploy this smart contract. If you get an
error, please ensure that a private key was created and attached to the node on
which you wish to deploy the smart contract.
![Select node to deploy](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/select-node-cli.png)

Select the private key you wish to use to deploy smart contract. If you are
using a public network or a network with gas fee, then make sure that this
private key's wallet is funded.
![Select private key to deploy](../../../img/building-with-settlemint/select-private-key-cli.png)

Select yes when prompted - **Confirm deploy to network (network name)? ›
(y/N)**.

Wait for a few minutes for the contrcat to be deployed.
